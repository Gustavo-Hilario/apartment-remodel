# Deployment Guide - Apartment Remodel App

This guide walks you through deploying your Apartment Remodel application online using free-tier services.

## üìã Overview

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.4 (deployed on Vercel)
- **Backend**: Express 5.1.0 (deployed on Render)
- **Database**: MongoDB (hosted on MongoDB Atlas)
- **Authentication**: Simple password protection

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours for complete setup

---

## Phase 1: Prepare Your Repository

### 1.1 Push to GitHub

If you haven't already, create a GitHub repository for this project:

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "feat: Initial commit for deployment"

# Create GitHub repository (visit github.com/new)
# Then connect your local repo:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 1.2 Verify Environment Files

Make sure you have:
- `.env.example` in the root directory (for backend)
- `client/.env.example` (for frontend)
- `.env.local` in both locations (for local development - NOT committed to Git)

---

## Phase 2: Set Up MongoDB Atlas (Database)

### 2.1 Create MongoDB Atlas Account

1. Go to [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
2. Sign up with Google, GitHub, or email
3. Choose the **FREE** tier (M0 Sandbox)

### 2.2 Create a Free Cluster

1. Click "Build a Database"
2. Select **M0 FREE** tier
3. Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure - doesn't matter)
4. Select a region closest to your users (e.g., US East, S√£o Paulo, etc.)
5. Name your cluster (e.g., "apartment-remodel")
6. Click "Create Cluster" (takes 3-5 minutes)

### 2.3 Set Up Database Access

**Create Database User:**
1. In the left sidebar, click "Database Access"
2. Click "Add New Database User"
3. Choose "Password" authentication
4. Username: `apartment_admin` (or your choice)
5. Click "Autogenerate Secure Password" - **COPY AND SAVE THIS PASSWORD**
6. Database User Privileges: "Read and write to any database"
7. Click "Add User"

**Configure Network Access:**
1. In the left sidebar, click "Network Access"
2. Click "Add IP Address"
3. Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0)
   - This is needed for Render to connect
   - For better security, you can add specific IPs later
4. Click "Confirm"

### 2.4 Get Connection String

1. Go to "Database" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Connect" on your cluster
3. Choose "Connect your application"
4. Driver: Node.js, Version: 5.5 or later
5. **Copy the connection string** - it looks like:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://apartment_admin:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
6. Replace `<password>` with the password you saved earlier
7. Add the database name before the `?`:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://apartment_admin:YOUR_PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/apartment_remodel?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

**Save this connection string** - you'll need it for Render deployment.

---

## Phase 3: Deploy Backend to Render

### 3.1 Create Render Account

1. Go to [https://render.com/](https://render.com/)
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended for easier deployment)
3. Authorize Render to access your GitHub repositories

### 3.2 Create New Web Service

1. Click "New +" in the top right
2. Select "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository (apartment-remodel)
4. Click "Connect"

### 3.3 Configure Service Settings

Fill in the following:

- **Name**: `apartment-remodel-api` (or your choice)
- **Region**: Choose closest to your users
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Root Directory**: Leave empty (backend is in root)
- **Environment**: `Node`
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `node scripts/server.js`
- **Plan**: **Free** (select this!)

### 3.4 Add Environment Variables

Click "Advanced" and add these environment variables:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `PORT` | `8000` |
| `MONGO_URL` | Your MongoDB Atlas connection string from Step 2.4 |
| `CLIENT_URL` | `https://your-app.vercel.app` (we'll update this after Vercel deployment) |

Click "Create Web Service"

### 3.5 Wait for Deployment

- Render will build and deploy your backend (takes 2-5 minutes)
- Once complete, you'll see a green "Live" status
- **Copy your Render URL** (e.g., `https://apartment-remodel-api.onrender.com`)
- Test it by visiting: `https://apartment-remodel-api.onrender.com/api/totals`

**Important Note**: Free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity. First load takes ~30 seconds.

## Phase 4: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

### 4.1 Create Vercel Account

1. Go to [https://vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup)
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended)
3. Authorize Vercel to access your repositories

### 4.2 Import Project

1. Click "Add New..." ‚Üí "Project"
2. Select your GitHub repository (apartment-remodel)
3. Click "Import"

### 4.3 Configure Project Settings

- **Framework Preset**: Next.js (should auto-detect)
- **Root Directory**: `client`

### 4.4 Add Environment Variables

Click "Environment Variables" and add:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `https://apartment-remodel-api.onrender.com/api` (your Render URL from Phase 3) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PASSWORD` | Choose a strong password for family access (e.g., `FamilyRemodel2025!`) |

### 4.5 Deploy

1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for build and deployment
3. Once complete, you'll get a URL like `https://your-app.vercel.app`
4. **Copy this URL**

### 4.6 Update Backend CORS

Go back to Render:
1. Navigate to your web service
2. Go to "Environment" tab
3. Update `CLIENT_URL` to your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Service will automatically redeploy

## Phase 5: Testing & Verification

### 5.1 Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your Vercel URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
2. You should see the login page
3. Enter the password you set in `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PASSWORD`
4. After login, verify:
   - Homepage loads with data
   - Products page works
   - Timeline page works
   - Budget and expense tracking works

### 5.2 Test Authentication

1. Logout (click logout button in navigation)
2. Try accessing the app directly - should redirect to login
3. Login again with the family password

### 5.3 Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue**: "Failed to load data" on homepage
- **Fix**: Check that Render backend URL is correct in Vercel environment variables
- **Fix**: Wait 30 seconds if backend was sleeping (free tier limitation)

**Issue**: Login doesn't work
- **Fix**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PASSWORD` is set correctly in Vercel

**Issue**: CORS errors
- **Fix**: Ensure `CLIENT_URL` in Render matches your Vercel URL exactly (with https://)

**Issue**: Database connection errors
- **Fix**: Verify MongoDB connection string in Render environment variables
- **Fix**: Check MongoDB Atlas Network Access allows 0.0.0.0/0
