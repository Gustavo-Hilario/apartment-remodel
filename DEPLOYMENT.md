# Deployment Guide - Apartment Remodel App

This guide walks you through deploying your Apartment Remodel application online using free-tier services.

## üìã Overview

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.4 (deployed on Vercel)
- **Backend**: Express 5.1.0 (deployed on Render)
- **Database**: MongoDB (hosted on MongoDB Atlas)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with role-based access control (Admin/Family/Guest)

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours for complete setup

---

## Phase 1: Prepare Your Repository

### 1.1 Push to GitHub

If you haven't already, create a GitHub repository for this project:

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "feat: Initial commit for deployment"

# Create GitHub repository (visit github.com/new)
# Then connect your local repo:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 1.2 Verify Environment Files

Make sure you have:
- `.env.example` in the root directory (for backend)
- `client/.env.example` (for frontend)
- `.env.local` in both locations (for local development - NOT committed to Git)

---

## Phase 2: Set Up MongoDB Atlas (Database)

### 2.1 Create MongoDB Atlas Account

1. Go to [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
2. Sign up with Google, GitHub, or email
3. Choose the **FREE** tier (M0 Sandbox)

### 2.2 Create a Free Cluster

1. Click "Build a Database"
2. Select **M0 FREE** tier
3. Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure - doesn't matter)
4. Select a region closest to your users (e.g., US East, S√£o Paulo, etc.)
5. Name your cluster (e.g., "apartment-remodel")
6. Click "Create Cluster" (takes 3-5 minutes)

### 2.3 Set Up Database Access

**Create Database User:**
1. In the left sidebar, click "Database Access"
2. Click "Add New Database User"
3. Choose "Password" authentication
4. Username: `apartment_admin` (or your choice)
5. Click "Autogenerate Secure Password" - **COPY AND SAVE THIS PASSWORD**
6. Database User Privileges: "Read and write to any database"
7. Click "Add User"

**Configure Network Access:**
1. In the left sidebar, click "Network Access"
2. Click "Add IP Address"
3. Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0)
   - This is needed for Render to connect
   - For better security, you can add specific IPs later
4. Click "Confirm"

### 2.4 Get Connection String

1. Go to "Database" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Connect" on your cluster
3. Choose "Connect your application"
4. Driver: Node.js, Version: 5.5 or later
5. **Copy the connection string** - it looks like:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://apartment_admin:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
6. Replace `<password>` with the password you saved earlier
7. Add the database name before the `?`:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://apartment_admin:YOUR_PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/apartment_remodel?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

**Save this connection string** - you'll need it for Render deployment.

### 3.4 Add Environment Variables

Click "Advanced" and add these environment variables:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |
| `PORT` | `8000` |
| `MONGO_URL` | Your MongoDB Atlas connection string from Step 2.4 |
| `CLIENT_URL` | `https://your-app.vercel.app` (we'll update this after Vercel deployment) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Generate a secure random string (e.g., use `openssl rand -base64 32`) |

Click "Create Web Service"

### 3.5 Wait for Deployment

- Render will build and deploy your backend (takes 2-5 minutes)
- Once complete, you'll see a green "Live" status
- **Copy your Render URL** (e.g., `https://apartment-remodel-api.onrender.com`)

  "role": "admin",
  "createdAt": {"$date": "2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z"}
}
```

**To generate a hashed password:**

Option 1 - Use Node.js locally:
```bash
node -e "const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs'); console.log(bcrypt.hashSync('YourPassword123!', 10));"
```

Option 2 - Use an online bcrypt generator (use reputable sites only):
- Generate a bcrypt hash with 10 salt rounds
- Copy the hash to the password field

**Important:** Save your login credentials securely!
